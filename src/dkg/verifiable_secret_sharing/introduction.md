### Introduction

Secret Sharing was first introducted by Shamir in 1979 {{#cite Sha79}}. It allows a person to share a secret \\(s\\) among \\(n\\) parties such that any \textit{authorized} subset of parties can use all their shares to reconstruct the secret, while any other (non-authorized) subset learns nothing about the secret from their shares. Shamir proposed a secret sharing scheme in his paper {{#cite Sha79}}.  However, in Shamir's scheme, parties can commit wrong shares, leading the protocol to reconstruct the wrong secret, thus a verification process of the shares is required. To solve this problem, Chor et al. {{#cite CGMA85}} introduced Verifiable Secret Sharing.
