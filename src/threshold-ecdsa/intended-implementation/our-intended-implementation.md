##   Threshold Signature Instatiations
In this section, we are going to discuss our concrete instatiations for the construction of Canneti et al and FROST. More specifically, we will discuss and analyse the security when instatiating the construction of Canneti et al using **secp256k1** parameters and FROST with **ed25519** and **sr25519** parameters to support the MPC version for these concrete variants.
