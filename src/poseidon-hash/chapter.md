# Poseidon hash for ZK applications

Many use cases of practical computational integrity proof systems such as SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs, involve *proving the knowledge of a preimage under a certain cryptographic hash function*, which is expressed as a circuit over a large prime field. However, the majority of hash functions do not perform computations in finite field, (SHA-256 in Zcash cryptocurrency), more constraints must be added in the circuit to represent the operations (for example, XOR, AND) in hash function as arithmetic operations in finite field. Hence, the expressed circuit could become very expensive due to the enormous number of hash constraints, leading to a huge computational
penalty. Therefore, new hash functions that performs natively with ZKP systems are needed.

In 2021, Grassi et al. {{#cite GKRRS21}} introduced \\(\mathsf{Poseidon}\\), a cryptographic hash function that supports arithmetic operations for values in finite field, and therefore friendly with ZK applications. \\(\mathsf{Poseidon}\\) uses \\(8\\) times fewer constraints per message bit than [Pedersen Hash], according to [here](https://iden3-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iden3_repos/research/publications/zkproof-standards-workshop-2/pedersen-hash/pedersen.html). The goal of this whole tutorial is to give a simpler explainations about Poseidon hash described the referenced paper.
